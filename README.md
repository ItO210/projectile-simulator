# Projectile Motion Simulation

A MATLAB-based simulation for modeling the motion of projectiles with and without air resistance.

This project was developed in **October 2022**

## Features

- Simulates multiple projectiles with different initial velocities and angles.
- Displays animated trajectories of the projectiles.
- Accounts for air resistance and gravity.

## Simulation

Here is an example of the simulation in action:

## Usage

1. Run the script `projectile.m` in MATLAB.
2. The program will prompt you for input values:
   - **Initial height** (in meters).
   - **Initial velocity** (in m/s).
   - **Launch angle** (in degrees).
   - **Drag coefficient** (a factor for air resistance).
3. The program will display an animated simulation of the projectiles, including real-time values of their position, velocity, and maximum height.
