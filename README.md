# Projectile Motion Simulation

A MATLAB-based simulation for modeling the motion of projectiles with and without air resistance.

## Features

- Simulates multiple projectiles with different initial velocities and angles.
- Displays animated trajectories of the projectiles.
- Accounts for air resistance and gravity.

## Simulation

Here is an example of the simulation in action:
